			The mission of Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) is teaching, research and service. Inherent in this mission is the responsibility of the Institute to educate its students to be responsible, civic minded citizens. The Code and Conduct of Students outlines student conduct and disciplinary policies that pertain to students and student organizations at IITG. It is designed to provide information to students, faculty and staff regarding the ideals that underlie our academic mission, and the expectations that the Institute has regarding the conduct of students. The purpose of the policies outlined in the Code and Conduct of Students is to protect the rights of all members of the IITG Community and to maintain an atmosphere in the community appropriate for an institution of higher education. Interpretations of provisions within the Code and Conduct of Students may be requested by contacting the Dean of Students� Affairs.

			relationship with the surrounding community and realize that it has tremendous social, cultural and economic impact on the community. Policy setting and enforcement (discipline) are ways of educating students to become conscientious members of that community, and students are expected to conduct themselves in a responsible manner at all times, whether on or off campus.

	The student discipline system exists to handle infractions against Institute rules and regulations. This system is based on a philosophy of fairness for all parties affected by any situation involving a student�s noncompliance with IITG policies and regulations.

	The student discipline system is designed for an educational system and does not function as a court of law. Therefore, procedural issues, including the introduction and consideration of evidence, are handled in a manner consistent with that educational focus. Where the allegations are more serious, and therefore the consequences more serious, the rules are structured appropriately. The student discipline system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts but, an additional option for complainants when the alleged violator is an enrolled IITG student.

	If a student or a group of students are cited by staff, faculty, or other students for a possible violation of civil laws and/or Institute policies on campus, they may be subject to either the disciplinary process of the institute and/or appropriate legal processes may be taken.

	If a student or a group of students is reported by community members for possible violations of law off-campus, the Institute will cooperate with appropriate officials taking necessary legal action. Further, if a student or a group of students is reported to the Institute authorities for violations off-campus, the Institute may intervene on a formal or an informal basis. The "informal" intervention will involve in the individual student or the group of students being referred to the Dean of Students� Affairs or a competent authority for discussions on the incident. Off campus behaviour which can have a significant impact on the mission of the institute may invite formal institute disciplinary actions.
